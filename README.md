# WASP Interpreter

WASP is a custom-designed programming language created from scratch. I designed and developed a fully functional interpreter for it, capable of parsing source files, managing scope, and executing instructions dynamically.

This project demonstrates how source code is parsed, interpreted, and executed, showcasing core concepts of language design and interpreter implementation.
